# Feedback from Robin

## R4DS HW 1 - Mitch
- No changes. Good job. 

##R4DS HW 2 - Mitch
- I like the simulation you did for the first problem
- Th summary of all of linear models seems like a bit too much information, maybe just use a couple. 

##ISLR CHAPTER 3 - Mitch
- On 4(a) I feel like the RSS would be lower for the linear regression since we know that the true relationship is linear. I'm 100% sure though. 
- I like how to plot grids look and save space
- On line 185 the function expand_scale() doesn't work for me, maybe the library isn't loaded.
