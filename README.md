## R4DS HW 1 - Mitch
- No changes. Good job. 


## R4DS HW 1 (Mitch)
* No changes. Good job. 

## R4DS HW 2 (Mitch)
- I like the simulation you did for the first problem
- Th summary of all of linear models seems like a bit too much information, maybe just use a couple. 

## ISLR CHAPTER 3 - Mitch
- On 4(a) I feel like the RSS would be lower for the linear regression since we know that the true relationship is linear. I'm 100% sure though. 
- I like how to plot grids look and save space
- On line 185 the function expand_scale() doesn't work for me, maybe the library isn't loaded.

##ISLR CHAPTER 5 - Mitch
- Good job, theres not much to add. I'm not sure what the cat() function is adding that a line of text wouldn't though. 

## ISLR Ch 4 (Robin)
- You can replace `cat()` language with inline R code. For example I could say there were ``` `r NROW(iris)` ``` observations in the Iris data set without having to `cat()` or `sprintf()` the output, or have it in a code chunk.
