## R4DS HW 1 (Mitch)
* No changes. Good job. 

## R4DS HW 2 (Mitch)
- I like the simulation you did for the first problem
- Th summary of all of linear models seems like a bit too much information, maybe just use a couple. 


## ISLR Ch 4 (Robin)
- You can replace `cat()` language with inline R code. For example I could say there were ``` `r NROW(iris)` ``` observations in the Iris data set without having to `cat()` or `sprintf()` the output, or have it in a code chunk.
